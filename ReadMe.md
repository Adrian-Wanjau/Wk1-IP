## DESCRIPTION
This is a webpage in which contains all the work i have done during my first week of learning at [MORINGA School](https://moringaschool.com/). It is a detailed project that shows everything i learned on each day in order and even has a little background details about who i am. It can also be used as a guide to show others what we learn at the current prep program there. It is also personally designed by me using css as i was taught while at the program. I used [Atom](https://code.visualstudio.com/) at the begining of the coding but later change to a better application, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), where i completed the project.
