## DESCRIPTION
This is a webpage in which contains all the work i have done during my first week of learning at [MORINGA School](https://moringaschool.com/). It is a detailed project that shows everything i learned on each day in order and even has a little background details about who i am. It can also be used as a guide to show others what we learn at the current prep program there. It is also personally designed by me as i was taught while at the program.
